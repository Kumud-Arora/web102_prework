Submitted by: Kumud Arora

Shoggoth Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* Responsive game card layout with hover effects
* Clean UI and Google Fonts integration

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* I had a challenge with setting everything up and making sure all the files were connected properly and the images showed up correctly.
* Overall, the project helped me practice breaking down a problem into smaller steps and focusing on one feature at a time before moving to the next.


## Future improvements:

* In the future, I could add a search bar for the users to look up the games by their names.
* I could also add a feature that sorts the game and shows the most popular ones based on the number of backers.
* I like how there's a top funded and runner up section for the games, however a least funded and second least funded would also help games reach their goal, so that can be added in the future as well.
